# Strato

##### Strato is an on-premise cloud platform based on servers with CPU and GPU components that enable you to solve both generic and specific computational problems using virtual machines that you can configure yourself. This can be for both short-term problem solving, as well as work that takes a long time.

!!! info "What is Strato?"

    Strato is a Linux-based virtual computer platform to support data driven research that needs additional processing capacity. Network storage allows users to store and process large datasets, and the OpenStack platform allows the user to change the size of the computer (processing capacity) that is connected to their boot disk.

    The Strato platform is a cluster of hardware that is virtualised to create instances that essentially function as a regular computer environment. Strato Instances are virtual machines, that can be launched by the user when they need it. When the instance has been created, it can be accessed from a terminal application on the user's local computer. The required software can then be installed and configured to the user's needs. By using Strato your research can benefit from additional RAM, CPU and GPU hardware. Strato can thus provide you with flexibility and additional computational power, when your research needs it.

<div class="grid cards grid-three" markdown>

-   __Synthetic data generation and probabilistic graphical model__

    ---

    Integrate the joint power of CPU and GPU in an interactive environment provided by Strato if you need to run your experiments on servers with many CPU cores, for example for creating synthetic data. For some methods, just like probabilistic graphical models, you can take advantage of the GPU available on this system and run the algorithms effectively.

-   __Developing natural language processing pipelines__

    ---

    Develop a natural language processing pipeline and create a set consisting of several natural language processing large language models. Involve extensive datasets in your projects with convenient memory and storage access possibilities of Strato with the possibility of GPU integration. Work in an individual and interactive environment.

-   __Graph data management and knowledge graphs__

    ---

    If you are planning to carry out CPU-intensive processes in your project, consider integrating Strato, which allows for explorative research thanks to its interactive environment - for example running queries or specialized algorithms while working on the graph data. Suitable for those whose analysis involves measuring the efficiency of the code, and where the code algorithms play a great role in the project.
