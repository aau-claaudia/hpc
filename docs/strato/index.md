## Virtual machines

It allows users to create virtual machines tailored to specific needs, providing flexible, scalable resources for a wide range of computational tasks, from short-term problem-solving to long-term projects. When the instance has been created, it can be accessed from a terminal application on the user's local computer. The required software can then be installed and configured to the user's needs. By using Strato your research can benefit from additional RAM, CPU and GPU hardware. Strato can thus provide you with flexibility and additional computational power, when your research needs it.

=== "Common use"
    * Training of models on GPUs
    * Collaboration on code development
    * Creation of Jupyter Notebook and RStudio Server hosts
    * Simulation of physics and biomolecular models
    * Testing of web applications
    * Teaching of advanced computational methods
    * Testing of distributed computing systems

=== "Recommended skills & knowledge"

    Operating Strato involves running your own Linux virtual machine and learning how to use the Linux terminal environment. It can also be useful to understand secure connections through SSH and secure file transfer protocols.
