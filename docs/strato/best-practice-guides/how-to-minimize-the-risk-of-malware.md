By adhering to these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of malware infections and strengthen the overall security posture of your STATO environment
 
### 1. **Use trusted repositories**
 
-   **Stick to official sources**: Always install software from your Linux distribution’s official repositories (e.g., APT for Ubuntu/Debian, YUM/DNF for CentOS/RHEL). These repositories are regularly vetted and maintained by trusted developers, ensuring a higher level of security.
 
-   **Verify external sources**: If you need to use third-party repositories or download packages from external sources, ensure they are well-known, trusted, and verified. Always check for digital signatures and authenticity.
 
### 2. **Opt for minimalist installation**
 
-   **Install only essential packages**: Limit the installation to only the software necessary for your server’s intended purpose. A minimalist approach reduces the potential attack surface by limiting the number of installed packages that could be compromised.
 
### 3. **Keep the operating system and packages up-to-date**
 
-   **Timely kernel and software updates**: Regularly update the Linux kernel and all installed packages to ensure that security vulnerabilities are promptly patched. Consider automating this process where possible to minimize delays.
 
### 4. **Implement strong access controls**
 
-   **Enforce Strong SSH Keys**: Mandate the use of strong, unique SSH keys for server access. Avoid using weak or default passwords.
