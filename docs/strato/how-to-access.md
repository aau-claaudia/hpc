## Strato Projects: Apply for additional quota
Strato Projects allow users to apply for additional quota to access additional processing capacity.Â GPU resources are limited and users are expected to follow a strict policy of deleting all GPU instances when not actively using the GPU. New instances can be very quickly created from existing volumes (boot disks), and GPU instances cannot be shelved and unshelved.

Strato Projects are available primarily to all researchers, and - if there are sufficient resources available - to students that are supporting researchers, and, finally, to student research projects. Each project requires the completion of a project request form.
