# Introduction to HPC

##### High-performance computing (HPC) refers to the use of powerful computing resources to tackle complex and resource-intensive tasks that exceed the capabilities of standard computing systems. For researchers and students at AAU, HPC provides the necessary power to train machine learning models, run simulations, perform data analysis, and conduct modeling, among other tasks. This capability is invaluable across a wide range of academic disciplines.

## Use cases

##### Find out how high-performance computing systems and their characteristics can be effectively utilized in certain computing practices.

<div class="grid cards grid-three" markdown>

-   __Transformer methods with large amount of data__

    ---

    AI Cloud might be a relevant choice when working with transformer methods in deep learning, and when the analysis involves a great amount of data– particularly image or video data. In this scenario, a good practice would be to test your jobs locally on a smaller scale, and involve the HPC afterwards, as it might take a long time to finish – depending how large is the data set you are working on.
