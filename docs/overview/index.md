# Introduction to HPC

High-performance computing (HPC) involves the use of powerful computing resources to perform computationally demanding tasks that are beyond the capability of traditional computing systems. HPC is used to process large datasets, perform simulations, and run resource-intensive applications, such as modelling climate patterns, simulating molecular behaviour, analysing genetic data, designing and testing products and structures, simulating fluid dynamics, optimizing manufacturing processes, identifying trends, and making predictions. HPC allows processing and analysis of complex data, leading to faster discoveries, more efficient processes, and better decision-making.
