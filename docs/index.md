## What is HPC?
High-performance computing (HPC) refers to the use of powerful computing resources to tackle complex and resource-intensive tasks that exceed the capabilities of standard computing systems. For researchers and students at AAU, HPC provides the necessary power to train machine learning models, run simulations, perform data analysis, and conduct modeling, among other tasks. This capability is invaluable across a wide range of academic disciplines.


#### Benefits from using HPC

-   :material-server-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Parallel computing__
    
    AAU HPC provides access to specialized processors that enhance the speed and processing capabilities of the system, enabling the execution of highly parallelizable tasks.

-   :material-speedometer:{ .lg .middle } __Fast data processing__
    
    HPC allows for much faster calculations than what your local machine can provide. Instead of reducing the data sets - reduce the processing time!

-   :material-laptop:{ .lg .middle } __Available at hand__
    
    Thanks to HPC, you can access your computing environment from anywhere using your laptop, allowing you to work independently.

<!-- ## News & Announcements

##### Overview of the new features, enhancements, and important maintenance updates for AAU HPC platforms.

!!! news "17-09-2024 - Service window"
    We have arranged the automatic security updates for all hosts on our OpenStack platform (Strato and UCloud virtual machines) and AI Cloud. The routine maintenance will start **00:01, 17th of September 2024**. We have reserved the entire day from 00:01 to 23:59, but the time required to restart hosts once all instances have been shut down is only a few minutes. Strato and UCloud virtual machines may still be affected by the maintenance on the CEPH storage, so you should expect some performance impact until that is completed. AI-Cloud will be unavailable throughout most of that day and will come back online towards the end of the workday. 

!!! news "26-08-2024 - 16 new NVIDIA H100 GPUs for UCloud"
    You can find 16 new NVIDIA H100 GPU resources on UCloud (select machine type u3-gpu). Read more [here](https://escience.sdu.dk/index.php/news/16-new-h100-ai-gpus-arrive-at-sdu/). -->
