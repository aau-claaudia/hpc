## News & Announcements

##### Overview of the new features, enhancements, and important maintenance updates for AAU HPC platforms.

!!! news "17-09-2024 - Service window"
    We have arranged the automatic security updates for all hosts on our OpenStack platform (Strato and UCloud virtual machines) and AI Cloud. The routine maintenance will start **00:01, 17th of September 2024**. We have reserved the entire day from 00:01 to 23:59, but the time required to restart hosts once all instances have been shut down is only a few minutes. Strato and UCloud virtual machines may still be affected by the maintenance on the CEPH storage, so you should expect some performance impact until that is completed. AI-Cloud will be unavailable throughout most of that day and will come back online towards the end of the workday. 

!!! news "26-08-2024 - 16 new NVIDIA H100 GPUs for UCloud"
    You can find 16 new NVIDIA H100 GPU resources on UCloud (select machine type u3-gpu). Read more [here](https://escience.sdu.dk/index.php/news/16-new-h100-ai-gpus-arrive-at-sdu/).
