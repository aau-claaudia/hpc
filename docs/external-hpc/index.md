# External HPC Facilites

In addition to the HPC platforms that we provide locally at AAU, users can gain access to several powerful platforms made available through national and european cooperation. We encourage all users to reach out for these resources - especially if they have large or continuous long-stretched resource needs. 

#### Consider applying for ressources on an external HPC facility if:

* You have a concrete research project which requires HPC-ressources.

* You need more compute time time, than you can acquire in our local platform portfolio.

* You need a specific resource type that is not available in our local platform portfolio.
