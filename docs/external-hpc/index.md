# External HPC Facilites

In addition to AAU's local HPC platforms, AAU researchers (and students) can get access to several powerful platforms made available through national and european HPC-cooperation.

Consider applying for ressources on an external HPC facility if:

- You have a concrete research project which requires HPC-ressources.
- You need more compute time than we can give you on our local platform portfolio.
- You need a specific resource type that is not available in our local platform portfolio.
