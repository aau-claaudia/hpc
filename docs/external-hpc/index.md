# External HPC Facilites

In addition to the HPC platforms that we provide locally at AAU, users can gain access to several powerful platforms made available through national and european cooperation.

We encourage all users to reach out for these resources - especially if they have large or continuous long-stretched resource needs. 

Researchers with less resource-demanding research projects are also welcome to apply for resources.

### National HPC ressources:
Available via applications to DeiC calls (abbr. Danish e-infrastructure Consortium). Learn more about these facilities and how to gain access - read our page on [DeiC HPC resources](/external-hpc/deic-resources/).

### European HPC resources:
Available via applications to EuroHPC calls. Learn more about these facilities and how to gain access - read our page on [EuroHPC resources](/external-hpc/eurohpc-resources/)

!!! info "Consider applying for ressources on an external HPC facility when:"

    - You have a concrete research project which requires HPC-ressources.
    - You need more compute time time, than you can acquire in our local platform portfolio.
    - You need a specific resource type that is not available in our local platform portfolio.
