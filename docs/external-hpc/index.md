# External HPC Facilites

In addition to the HPC platforms that we provide locally at AAU, users can gain access to several powerful platforms made available through national and european cooperation.

* **The national HPC ressources** are made available through DeiC (abbr. Danish e-infrastructure Consortium). To learn more about these facilities and how to gain access - read our page on [DeiC HPC resources](/external-hpc/deic-resources/).

* **The european HPC resources** are made available through EuroHPC. To learn more about these facilities and how to gain access - read our page on [EuroHPC resources](/external-hpc/eurohpc-resources/)

We encourage users to reach out for these resources - especially if they have large or continuous long-stretched resource needs

Consider applying for ressources on an external HPC facility if:

- You have a concrete research project which requires HPC-ressources.
- You need more compute time time, than you can acquire in our local platform portfolio.
- You need a specific resource type that is not available in our local platform portfolio.
