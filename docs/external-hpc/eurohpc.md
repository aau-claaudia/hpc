# EuroHPC

##### Aalborg University researchers are eligible to use the supercomputers of the EuroHPC. You can gain access through calls for applications, much like project funding from public and private research funders such as Independent Research Fund Denmark, Novo Nordisk Foundation, Horizon Europe etc. The major difference here is that in contrast to many other research funders, who grant money for research projects, EuroHPC grants time - which you as a researcher can spend using the supercomputers. As such, computing resources from EuroHPC are a form of external research funding.

- __What is EuroHPC?__ 

    ---

    EuroHPC offers access to a variety of supercomputers across Europe. You apply for computational time rather than funding, which can be crucial for large-scale research.

- __Available Supercomputers__ 

    ---

    With eight supercomputers (e.g., LUMI with 550 petaflops peak performance), EuroHPC supports everything from smaller to extreme-scale research needs. LUMI is currently the world’s 3rd fastest supercomputer.

## Scale of the possibilities
EuroHPC’s facilities consist of a number of supercomputers (8 as of June 2023) and more are coming. The supercomputers range from smaller facilities like Discoverer at around 6 petaflops peak performance to LUMI at around 550 petaflops peak performance. LUMI is the world’s 3rd fastest supercomputer as of June 2023. Through the EuroHPC, you can get access to these supercomputers (follow the link for user documentation):

* [LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/)
* [LEONARDO](https://leonardo-supercomputer.cineca.eu/hpc-system/)
* [MARENOSTRUM 5](https://www.bsc.es/user-support/mn4.php)
* [VEGA](https://doc.vega.izum.si/)
* [MELUXINA](https://docs.lxp.lu/)
* [KAROLINA](https://docs.it4i.cz/karolina/hardware-overview/)

#### How to get access to EuroHPC?

EuroHPC works with several different access modes: Benchmark & Development, Regular, and Extreme Scale Access. Applying for the HPC resources works like applying for other research grants. However, the important differeneces are that HPC facilities grant compute hours instead of money as well as the application process is much shorter and simpler than what you might be used to regarding other applications.

!!! info "Benchmark & Development Access"
    Meant for preparatory work to figure out how to get your software to run and estimate how many resources you need in a Regular or Extreme Scale application.

    You can apply for Benchmark & Development Access (small amount of resources) each month with a time-to-access of two weeks after the deadline.

!!! info "Regular Access"
    For “normal” use of the supercomputers, typically using a fraction of a supercomputer for some amount of time.

    Regular Access (large amount of resources) can be applied for approximately twice a year with 4 months’ time-to-access after the deadline.

!!! info "Extreme Scale Access"
    For those who need to more or less “max out” an entire supercomputer for a considerable amount of time.

    Extreme Scale Access (extremely large amount of resources) can be applied for approximately twice a year with 6 months’ time-to-access after the deadline.


| Access mode | Objective | Application deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Benchmark & Development | Testing the software on the facility and benchmarking it to estimate how many resources you need. | Deadline every month; grant decision within 2 weeks. |
| Regular Access | Ordinary research use of the system, min. thousands of GPU-hours. | Deadline twice a year; grant decision within 4 months. |Deadline twice a year; grant decision within 4 months. |
| Extreme Scale Access | For huge projects | Deadline 2-3 times a year; grant decision within 6 months. |

## Get assistance 
Using large supercomputers does require a certain level of technical skills, but [CLAAUDIA](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=82a253e8838fc21053711d447daad328) is here to guide you along the way. We can introduce you to the concepts through smaller-scale local or national facilities and assist you in evolving your computational methods to the necessary level. We can guide you through the application process and help you maximise your chances of being awarded the resources you need.
