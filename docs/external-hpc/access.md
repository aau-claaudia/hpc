This section gives an overview of the oppurtunities for accessing external HPC facilities. All of the resources described below are accessible by both researchers and students.

If you have any questions, or would like assistance with applying for external HPC resources - reach out to CLAAUDIA via the serviceportal form [*Access CLAAUDIA services*](https://aau.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=34e8536083cfc21053711d447daad30a).

## DeiC HPC resources
[DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/en/about-deic) is the overarching body, responsible for coordinating HPC efforts across all the danish universities. DeiC grants a portion of it's resources to the danish universities (on AAU these are administered by CLAAUDIA). A large portion is also reserved for a national HPC resource pools, from which researchers can apply twice a year.

| Access call | Objective | Deadline | Grant decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AAU's local resource pool | Modest grants for both regular project work and testing purposes | None (continuous handouts) | Typically the same day. |
| DeiC's national resource pool | For projects that require large amounts of compute resources | Mid march / mid july | June / December |

  The national application calls are always announced on [DeiC's website](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources). Applications are submitted through the [e-grant service](https://www.e-grant.dk/) - also see DeiC's [guide on using the service](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/documents/PDF/E-resource%20Application%20Guide%20v%201.3.pdf). 
As for what goes into an application, a good approach would be to look at the questions presented in the application form on the e-grant service, and further you should see the section ["Assessment criteria"](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/Proces%20for%20national%20call%20for%20e-resources.pdf#page=10) of the proces overview.

## EuroHPC resources

[EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/about/discover-eurohpc-ju_en) is the body responsible for coordinating HPC efforts on the european level. 
The following is a brief summary of [the official page for EuroHPC access calls](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/supercomputers-access-calls_en).

| Access call | Objective | Deadline | Grant decision |

| [Extreme Scale](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-extreme-scale-access-mode_en) | For very large resource needs. | 2 times each year | 6 months |

With a EuroHPC grant it is also possible to apply for HPC Expertise support from [EPICURE](https://deic.dk/en/news/2025-4-10/get-free-access-to-european).
