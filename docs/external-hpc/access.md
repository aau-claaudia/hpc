This section gives an overview of the oppurtunities for accessing national and european HPC facilities. All of the resources described below are accessible by both researchers and students.


## Local and national HPC resources 
[DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/en/about-deic) is the overarching national body responsible for coordinating national HPC efforts on across all the danish universities, and they are responsible for distributing compute time on national facilities.

DeiC grants a portion of it's resources to the danish universities - these are the *local resources* to the national HPC facilities.
Another large portion is reserved for a *national resource pool*, from which researchers can apply twice a year.

| Access call | Objective | Deadline | Grant decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AAU's local resource pool | Modest grants for both regular project work and testing purposes | None (continuous handouts) | Typically the same day. |
| DeiC's national resource pool | For projects that require larger amounts of resources | Mid march / mid july | June / December |

!!! info "Useful information for applications to the national resources"
    * The national application calls are always announced on [DeiC's website](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources). Look for the **call text**, to learn about available resources, the proces, etc.
    * Applications are submitted through the [e-grant service](https://www.e-grant.dk/) (structured as an application form with a series of questions).
        * It's possible to get an overview of these questions by logging in to the platform, or viewing see DeiC's [guide on using the service](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/documents/PDF/E-resource%20Application%20Guide%20v%201.3.pdf)). 
        * Further it can also be useful to read the section ["Assessment criteria"](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/Proces%20for%20national%20call%20for%20e-resources.pdf#page=10) of the official process description.

!!! questions "Questions regarding national grants"

    If you have questions about <u>an application</u> to a national grant - reach out to CLAAUDIA via [serviceportal.aau.dk](https://aau.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=34e8536083cfc21053711d447daad30a).

    If you have questions regarding <u>an existing</u> national grant - reach out to DeiC's HPC back office through their [service desk](https://deic-backoffice.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).



## European resources

[EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/about/discover-eurohpc-ju_en) is the body responsible for coordinating HPC efforts on the european level. There is a number of calls from which HPC-resources can be acquired. The following is a brief summary of [the official page for EuroHPC access calls](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/supercomputers-access-calls_en).

| Access call | Objective | Deadline | Grant decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Benchmark access](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-benchmark-access_en) | For testing your software on the facility and benchmarking it to estimate how many resources you need. | Every month | 2-3 weeks |
| [Development access](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-development-access_en) | For testing your software on the facility and benchmarking it to estimate how many resources you need. | Every month | 2-3 weeks |
| [Regular access](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-regular-access-mode_en) | Regular project work handouts | Late march / late september  | 4 months |
| [Extreme Scale](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-extreme-scale-access-mode_en) | For very large resource needs. | 2 times each year | 6 months |
| [AI for Science and Collaborative EU projects](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-ai-science-and-collaborative-eu-projects_en) | Intended for projects that focus on AI/ML - especially foundation models and generative AI | Every two months | 1 month |

!!! info "Assistance with writing applications to EuroHPC"
    [The Danish National Competency Centre](https://www.deic.dk/en/EuroCC2) provides support for researchers interested in submitting applications to EuroHPC. They provide help with selecting an HPC facility together an appropriate resource type that fits your project, and they give detailed advice before submitting the application. [Reach out to them here](mailto:dennis.wollbrink@deic.dk), if you are interested in this oppurtunity.

### EPICURE
[EPICURE](https://epicure-hpc.eu/support-services/) aims to provide in-depth, HPC-expertise assisstance to research projects, that wish to make the most of their EuroHPC grants. Their services include:

- Porting your application to a chosen HPC facility
- Code refactoring, benchmarking and optimization to improve performance and enable scaling across multiple nodes
