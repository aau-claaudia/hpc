This section gives an overview of the oppurtunities for accessing national and european HPC facilities. All of the facilities mentioned in this section are available for both researchers and students.

## National HPC resources (and local)

!!! info "How it's structured"

    [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/en/about-deic) is the overarching national body responsible for coordinating national HPC efforts on across all the danish universities. Among other things, they are responsible for distributing compute time on national HPC facilities.

    - DeiC grants a portion of it's resources to the danish universities for them to hand out. These are the **local resources** to the national HPC facilities.

    - Another portion is reserved for a **national resource pool**, from which researchers can apply twice a year.

### National HPC facilities

Find an overview of the national facilities on our page [Overview of facilities](/external-hpc/facilities/).

### Applications to the local resource pool

**Objective:** Testing purposes - but grants are also handed out in modest amounts for regular project work

**Deadline:** None (continuous handouts)

**Grant decision**: Typically same day

**Proces:**

In the beginning of every year CLAAUDIA receives an amount of resources to hand out to researchers, who wish to use one of the national platforms. Overall our objective is to make the most of these resources - we aim to strike a balance between maximum utilisation, whilst retaining general availability for our users throughout the year.

**How to apply:**

* **Ucloud:** See our ["How to acess"](/ucloud/how-to-access) page for UCloud.
* **Computerome, GenomeDK, Sophia:** Fill out [the application form](https://forms.office.com/e/DxRA4hPK84).
* **LUMI:** Fill out [the application form](https://forms.office.com/e/4XC48iVu4S).


!!! questions "Questions regarding the local pool for national HPC facilities"
    Reach out to CLAAUDIA via [serviceportal.aau.dk](https://aau.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=34e8536083cfc21053711d447daad30a).

### Applications to the national resource pool

**Objective:** To allow researchers to apply for medium-large sized resource grants

**Deadline**: March / September

**Grant decision**: June / December

**Proces:**

In the beginning of the year a new call is made available and researchers have a 3-month window in which they can apply. When the window ends there is a period, where a scientific committee evaluates the applications that have been submitted. After this proces has been completed, applicants receive a response on the decision - 6 months after the call opened. This cycle repeats twice a year.

**How to apply:**

The national application calls are always announced on [DeiC's website](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources) - look for the *call text* (pdf), to learn about available resources, the proces, etc. Applications are submitted through the [e-grant service](https://www.e-grant.dk/) (structured as an application form with a series of questions). It's possible to get an overview of these questions by logging in to the platform, or viewing see DeiC's [guide on using the service](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/documents/PDF/E-resource%20Application%20Guide%20v%201.3.pdf)). Further it can also be useful to read the section ["Assessment criteria"](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/Proces%20for%20national%20call%20for%20e-resources.pdf#page=10) of the official process description.

!!! questions "Questions regarding national HPC grants"

    If you have questions about <u>an application</u> to a national grant - reach out to CLAAUDIA via [serviceportal.aau.dk](https://aau.service-now.com/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=34e8536083cfc21053711d447daad30a).

    If you have questions regarding <u>an existing</u> national grant - reach out to DeiC's HPC back office through their [service desk](https://deic-backoffice.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

## European HPC resources


!!! info "How it's structured"

    [EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/about/discover-eurohpc-ju_en) is the body responsible for coordinating HPC efforts on the european level. There is a number of calls from which HPC-resources can be acquired. The following is a brief summary of [the official page for EuroHPC access calls](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/supercomputers-access-calls_en).

### EuroHPC facilities

Find an overview of the HPC facilities accessible with EuroHPC resources on EuroHPC page ["Our Supercomputers"](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/our-supercomputers_en).




Together with a EuroHPC grant it is also possible to apply for HPC expert assistance from [EPICURE](https://epicure-hpc.eu/support-services/). This is in-depth support from an expert user, who will sit down with you and help port your application to the HPC facility, help you with code refactoring, benchmarking and optimization in order to improve performance and enable scaling across multiple nodes.

### Applicatons to EuroHPC


There are multiple calls throughout the year. Find them in the table below:

| Access call | Objective | Deadline | Grant decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Benchmark access](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-benchmark-access_en) | For testing your software on the facility and benchmarking it to estimate how many resources you need. | Every month | 2-3 weeks |
| [Development access](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-development-access_en) | For testing your software on the facility and benchmarking it to estimate how many resources you need. | Every month | 2-3 weeks |
| [Regular access](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-regular-access-mode_en) | Regular project work handouts | Late march / late september  | 4 months |
| [Extreme Scale](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-extreme-scale-access-mode_en) | For very large resource needs. | 2 times each year | 6 months |
| [AI for Science and Collaborative EU projects](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-ju-call-proposals-ai-science-and-collaborative-eu-projects_en) | Intended for projects that focus on AI/ML - especially foundation models and generative AI | Every two months | 1 month |

!!! tip "Assistance with writing applications to EuroHPC"
    [The Danish National Competency Centre for HPC](https://www.deic.dk/en/EuroCC2) provides support for researchers interested in submitting applications to EuroHPC. Their guidance includes selecting an HPC facility that fits your objectives together with an appropriate resource type. They give detailed advice before submitting applications to EuroHPC.
