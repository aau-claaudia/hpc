## National facilities

In the table below you will find links for quickly learning about the available platforms. The data classification annotations are according to [AAU's data classification scheme](https://www.security.aau.dk/data-classification#what-is-data-classification?).

| Facility | Objective | Hardware | Software | Data classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [UCloud](/ucloud) | General purpose compute cluster with intuitive web interface | [link](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/guide/resources-products.html)| [link](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/tutorials/tutorial2.html) | 0, 1, 2, 3|
| [Sophia](https://dtu-sophia.github.io/docs/) | General purpose compute cluster | [link](https://dtu-sophia.github.io/docs/hardware/) | [link](https://dtu-sophia.github.io/docs/modules/) | 0, 1 |

The national facilities can all be accessed with resources from AAU's local resource pool or DeiC's national resource pool. Learn more about this in our section: [How to access](/external-hpc/access).

## European facilities

A complete overview of the facilities can be found on [EuroHPC's website](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/our-supercomputers_en).

These facilities can be accessed with resources acquired from one of the [EuropHPC access calls](external-hpc/access/#eurohpc-resources).
