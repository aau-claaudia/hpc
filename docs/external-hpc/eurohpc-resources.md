[EuroHPC](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/about/discover-eurohpc-ju_en) is the body responsible for coordinating HPC efforts on the european level. There is a number of calls from which HPC-resources can be acquired. The following is a brief summary of [the official page for EuroHPC access calls](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/supercomputers-access-calls_en).

## EuroHPC facilities

Find an overview of the HPC facilities accessible with EuroHPC resources on EuroHPC page ["Our Supercomputers"](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/supercomputers/our-supercomputers_en).

## EPICURE
Together with a EuroHPC grant it is also possible to apply for HPC expert assistance from [EPICURE](https://epicure-hpc.eu/support-services/). This is in-depth support from an expert user, who will sit down with you and help port your application to the HPC facility, help you with code refactoring, benchmarking and optimization in order to improve performance and enable scaling across multiple nodes.

!!! tip "Assistance with writing applications to EuroHPC"
    [The Danish National Competency Centre for HPC](https://www.deic.dk/en/EuroCC2) provides support for researchers interested in submitting applications to EuroHPC. Their guidance includes selecting an HPC facility that fits your objectives together with an appropriate resource type. They give detailed advice before submitting applications to EuroHPC.
