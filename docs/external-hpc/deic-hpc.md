# DeiC HPC

##### Through the Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DeiC), CLAAUDIA can provide access to HPC facilities run at a national scale. These facilities have different capabilities and target groups.

-   #### DeiC Throughput HPC
    
    DeiC Throughput HPC allows users to submit jobs to a queue system on a large cluster of CPU servers which then executes the job. These systems allow for much larger pools of resources to be used, but the user cannot interact directly with the hardware. Facilities includes [DTU Sophia](https://dtu-sophia.github.io/docs/), [GenomeDK](https://genome.au.dk/docs/hardware/), and [Computerome 2.0](https://escience.sdu.dk/index.php/type-2-computerome/).

-   #### DeiC Large Memory HPC

    Large Memory HPC is very much like Throughput HPC but offers significantly larger memory (or RAM) possibilities. There is only one facility currently offering this format of HPC in Denmark, [HIPPO](https://docs.hpc-type3.sdu.dk/).
    
-   #### LUMI-capability HPC

    [LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/) is the largest supercomputer that AAU users can get access to via DeiC. It functions very much like Throughput HPC and Large Memory HPC, in that users submit containerised jobs to a queue system. In addition, it includes both CPU and GPU processing capabilities.

#### How to get access to DeiC HPC?

There are three ways of getting access to DeiC HPC resources. Apart from those, access to DeiC Interactive HPC (UCloud) is described [here](/ucloud/how-to-access/)

!!! info "The local pool of resources"
    This access is similar to the DeiC Sandbox option, in that there are limited resources available, and projects that require more than 100 000 core hours will not be approved. Roughly half of the total annual time available on HPC systems is shared out between then universities for local resource allocation.

    For example, a researcher that might want to try Throughput HPC could apply for 10 000 to 50 000 CPU hours on the Sophia Throughput HPC facility at DTU.

    **When is this access type suitable?**
    
    These local resources can be a good way to get early access to the HPC system that you need, and to establish a strong case for an application for a large single project through the DeiC semi-annual applications.

    **Who should you contact?**
    
    Applications for local resources are managed and reviewed by [CLAAUDIA](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=82a253e8838fc21053711d447daad328), but the actual setup of user profiles and system specific guidance is offered by each of the providers separately.

    DeiC Large Memory HPC is not available via AAU local resources, but is included as a DeiC Sandbox possibility.

!!! info "DeiC Sandbox resources"
    **When is this access type suitable?**
    
    DeiC offers a sandbox option for researchers that want to try one of the HPC installations. These applications are evaluated by DeiC on a continuous basis, and there is typically two to three weeks waiting time for a response on the application.

    There are limited resources available, but you should get access to enough capacity to test whether you are able to execute a trial or test run on a sample of your data. This can be an alternative to using local resources in preparation for a larger applications for national resources.

    **What is the application process**
    DeiC reserves 5% of all national resources (including Large Memory HPC) for sandbox applications. The applications (about 2 pages long) must be submitted to DeiC directly, and are handled in a relatively short time (with roughly a 2-week processing period). DeiC reviews and approves or rejects the applications. These resources are also limited, and no large projects will be approved for Sandbox applications.

    For example, a researcher that might want to try LUMI Capability HPC could apply for 10 000 to 100 000 CPU hours on the LUMI HPC facility in Finland.

    **Who should you contact?**
    
    Contact [CLAAUDIA](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=82a253e8838fc21053711d447daad328) if you are interested in this option.

!!! info "DeiC National HPC resources"
    **When is this access type suitable?**
    
    DeiC semi-annual applications are for large individual projects, and this constitutes the other half of the total annual HPC resources available via DeiC.

    It is possible to apply for either 1 year or two years of access, and this access is granted for each half of the year, starting from the 1st January, or 1st July following the application period.

    **Who should you contact?**
    
    The success rate of applications is significantly higher for those researchers that have consulted with [CLAAUDIA](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=82a253e8838fc21053711d447daad328) prior to submitting an application. As the front office for DeiC at AAU, CLAAUDIA is able to provide clear guidance on what should be included.
