 [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/en/about-deic) is the overarching national body responsible for coordinating national HPC efforts on across all the danish universities. Among other things, they are responsible for distributing compute time on national HPC facilities.

 - DeiC grants a portion of it's resources to the danish universities, for the purpose of providing direct access for their researchers. These are the **local resources** to the national HPC facilities.

 - Another portion is reserved for a larger **national resource pool**, from which researchers can apply twice a year.

!!! info "Which HPC platforms can be applied to?"

    The national HPC facilities are those in which DeiC has a stake and are provided to all universities via the national and local resource pools.

## Applications to the local resource pool

**Objective:** Testing purposes - but grants are also handed out in modest amounts for regular project work

**Deadline:** None (continuous handouts)

**Grant decision**: Typically same day

**Proces:**

In the beginning of every year CLAAUDIA receives an amount of resources to hand out to researchers, who wish to use one of the national platforms. Overall our objective is to make the most of these resources - we aim to strike a balance between maximum utilisation, whilst retaining general availability for our users throughout the year.

**How to apply:**

* **UCloud:** See our ["How to acess"](/ucloud/how-to-access) page for UCloud.
* **Computerome, GenomeDK, Sophia:** Fill out [the application form](https://forms.office.com/e/DxRA4hPK84).
* **LUMI:** Fill out [the application form](https://forms.office.com/e/4XC48iVu4S).

## Applications to the national resource pool

**Objective:** To allow researchers to apply for medium-large sized resource grants

**Deadline**: March / September

**Grant decision**: June / December

**Proces:**

In the beginning of the year a new call is made available and researchers have a 3-month window in which they can apply. When the window ends there is a period, where [a scientific committee](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources/E-resource-committee) evaluates the applications that have been submitted based on [criteria](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/Proces%20for%20national%20call%20for%20e-resources.pdf#page=10). After this proces has been completed, applicants receive a response on the decision - 6 months after the call opened. This cycle repeats twice a year.

**How to apply:**

The national application calls are always announced on [DeiC's website](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/Apply-for-HPC-resources) - look for the *call text* (pdf), to learn about available resources, the proces, etc. Applications are submitted through the [e-grant service](https://www.e-grant.dk/) (structured as an application form with a series of questions). It's possible to get an overview of these questions by logging in to the platform, or viewing see DeiC's [guide on using the service](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/documents/PDF/E-resource%20Application%20Guide%20v%201.3.pdf)). Further it can also be useful to read the section ["Assessment criteria"](https://www.deic.dk/sites/default/files/Proces%20for%20national%20call%20for%20e-resources.pdf#page=10) of the official process description.
