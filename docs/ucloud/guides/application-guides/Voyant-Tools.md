There are several options here, and it can seem overwhelming. For this example, we’ll walk through the quickest way to start the app.

### 1.2.1 Choose a name for your job

* Pick a name that makes it easy to find your work later and distinguish between different jobs
* Write the name under “Job Name”.
* Example: "Voyant_demo1".
**Note:** Job and file names cannot include special characters such as "æøå".

### 1.2.2 Select the duration of your job

* Select the duration of your job and enter the number under “Hours”
* You need to estimate for how long time you will need to use the app. The application can take some time to show results, because it analyzes all text before showing you, afterwards you can edit what types of reading or analysis you will receive.

**Note:** If you run out of allocated time, the application still shows the results, but you cannot use the functions or make any changes. You can allocate more time after starting the job if needed.

### 1.2.3 Pick a machine to use

* We recommend the u1-standard-16.

Now the application pops op in a new window and you can upload the files you would like to work on. The entire text collection you are working on is called corpus in the application. 

There are three main ways of selecting a corpus in Voyant Tools:

1.	type or paste into the main text area, either normal text or a
2.	insert a URL link to a webpage, one per line. 
3.	Upload one or more files from your computer. 

The upload file selector should allow you to choose one or more files using Ctrl and Shift keys. If you have several documents to add at once, it may be easiest to first create a zip archive containing the files and then upload the one zip file.

It is possible to work on one or more files and have combination of files and webpages. 

* Press “Reveal” when you have all the texts for the corpus.
