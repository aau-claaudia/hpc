Transcriber is an app for transcribing audio into text. Many apps can do this, but like it’s sister transcription app, Whisper, Transcriber is a little different in a big way. Located on UCloud on the DeiC Interactive HPC it can handle sensitive data. Transcriber is developed to support features not available with the Whisper-based technology, such as speech recognition. Transcriber is available for everyone with access to UCloud.

!!! info "Feedback is appreciated"
    Transcriber is still under development and getting new features. Please give us your feedback via the [AAU service portal](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0a246b54c353f150f5575dcd2b013105).


## Sensitive data?
For employees at AAU:

When working on the UCloud platform, the department of Grants and Contracts at AAU has determined that personal data must be handled inside of the Project environment. The Project environment is only available for employees at AAU.  

If your audio files do not contain personal data, then you can simply use your “My workspace” environment.​

All projects with sensitive data must include the following two project numbers:

1. A project reference number from Grants and Contracts
2. A DeiC Interactive HPC project number from CLAAUDIA
3. 
How to get these numbers is described [here](/ucloud/how-to-access/#Projects).

UCloud’s data classification maps to the AAU data classification model in the following way:​

* AAU Level 0: Public information = UCloud: Inherit.
* AAU Level 1: Internal information = UCloud: Private.
* AAU Level 2: Confidential information - UCloud: Confidential.
* AAU Level 3: Sensitive information - UCloud: Sensitive. (Only permitted to be added to your registered and approved project folder.) Sensitive data may NOT be added to My Workspace.
