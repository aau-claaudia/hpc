If your UCloud project involves an external collaborator who does not have standard WAYF access to UCloud, you need to follow the procedure below.

### Procedure for Adding External Collaborators on UCloud

1. **Sensitive Data Projects**:  
    - If your project includes sensitive data, please follow the [Sensitive Data Process](/ucloud/terms-and-conditions/#procedure-for-working-with-sensitive-data-on-ucloud-projects) before proceeding.
        - The external collaborator should be approved by grants and contacts to get access to the data. 

2. **Request a Guest Account**:  
    - The external collaborator must be registered as a guest researcher at your institute or department.  
        - You should contact the relevant person at their institute to request a guest AAU AD user account.

3. **Log In and Accept Terms**:  
   - Once the guest account is created, the collaborator must log into UCloud and accept the platform's Terms and Conditions (SLA).

4. **Add the Collaborator to Your Project**:  
   - The Principal Investigator (PI) can now add the collaborator to the project, just like any other pre-approved participant.
