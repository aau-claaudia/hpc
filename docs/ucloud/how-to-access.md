## Who can access?
All Aalborg University users automatically have access to UCloud and can simply log in using their WAYF credentials (university logon credentials). This gives you access to a fairly substantial starting quota that can be used in the standard web app environment. This is also the quickest and most user-friendly way to access HPC as a first-time user.

## UCloud Projects: Apply for additional quota
UCloud projects allow you to share a workspace with colleagues, and to access additional resources. These resources are split into three groups, virtual machines, CPU compute and GPU compute.

### How to get access to a UCloud Project?
Creating a project requires a two-step application process. 

1. First you must [apply to CLAAUDIA for a DeiC Interactive HPC project](https://forms.office.com/e/8Khbr1TJGC){target="_blank}. 
2. Second, if your project is approved, you must apply for the approved resources via the UCloud web interface.

You will need to create a project on the platform – [see the section Project Workspace](https://docs.cloud.sdu.dk/guide/project-overview.html){target="_blank} in the official documentation. After the approval of the UCloud application, your project will be awarded the requested compute resources available on the platform.
