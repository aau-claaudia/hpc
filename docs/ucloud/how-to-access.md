## Direct access
All Aalborg University users automatically have access to UCloud and can simply log in using their WAYF credentials (university logon credentials). This gives you access to **"My Workspace"** with a starting quota of 2000 CPU-hours that can be used in the standard web app environment. This is the quickest and most user-friendly way to access HPC as a first-time user.
