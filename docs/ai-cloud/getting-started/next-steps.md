To further explore and enhance your use of AI Cloud, we recommend to take a look at the following guides:

- Before running a job, learn how to [**check the queue**](../additional-guides/checking-the-queue.md) to see how many jobs are ahead of you or review your own job status
- Submit a job to Slurm with a [**batch script**](../additional-guides/run-a-batch-script.md) - a text file containing all the Slurm arguments you would otherwise enter in the terminal
- Learn how to [**monitor the resource status of compute nodes**](../additional-guides/checking-the-status-of-compute-nodes.md)
- Implement [**checkpointing**](../additional-guides/checkpointing.md) with Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to allow your jobs to resume from a saved state after interruptions
