## Who can get access?
All researchers at AAU can get access to AI Cloud. If you're a student, use [AI-LAB](/ai-lab/), which is similar to AI Cloud but built for AAU students. If you need more GPU power, you can request access to AI Cloud with a strong justification, and your supervisor must submit the access request for you.

## 1. Fill out the application form
Please fill in the [access request form](https://forms.office.com/e/ewgvLRbbv7){target="_blank} to get started using AI Cloud. Supervisors should fill in the form for their students.

## 2. Processing of your request
The request is processed manually, so please expect a bit of delay before you can start using AI Cloud.
