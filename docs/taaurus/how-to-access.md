 ## Overview of the application process

 Working on TAAURUS requires a two‑part application. You must complete Part 1 before submitting Part 2.

 ### Part 1 – Plan your research project

 Use **[this form](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=04934a6cc3a5e210f0f3041ad00131fc)** to describe your project and compute needs.

 A long with this you should:

 - [Initiate GDPR registration for the project](https://aaudk.sharepoint.com/sites/persondata-ressourcer/SitePages/Anmeldelse%20og%20registreringer.aspx)
 - [Initiate the relevant ethical approvals](https://forms-intern.aau.dk/dialogue/AAU084/Ansgning_om_forskningsetisk_godkendelse)
 - [Start a data management plan (DMP)](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/research-data-and-software/data-management/data-management-planning)

     >For writing a Data Management Plan (DMP), we recommend using [DeiC DMP](https://dmp.deic.dk/plans/new), but other DMP tools are also acceptable. At CLAAUDIA, we support the use of DeiC DMP and can guide you in using the system. We also offer [consulting and guidance](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=66738c41c3c34610f0f3041ad001310d) on how to write a DMP.

 !!! info "Timing of approvals"
     These items do not need to be fully approved to submit Part 1, but they must be approved before you submit Part 2.

 After Part 1 is submitted, you can proceed to Part 2 once the items above have been approved.

 ### Part 2 – Create your TAAURUS project

 Use [this form](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=3f559ee0c329e210f0f3041ad00131c8) to request creation of the actual project on TAAURUS. This step can only be completed when Part 1 is submitted and your GDPR/ethics/DMP work has been initiated. The form must be submitted by the project’s Principal Investigator (PI).
