# AI-LAB

##### AI-LAB is designed exclusively for students at Aalborg University, offering high-performance computing (HPC) right at your fingertips. Think of it as a mini supercomputer, packed with GPUs, making it a perfect playground for training deep learning models, running simulations, and performing high-speed data analysis.

!!! info "What is AI-LAB?"

    AI-LAB is a high-performance computing (HPC) platform developed for students and educators at Aalborg University. It functions like a mini supercomputer, equipped with advanced hardware, including NVIDIA GPUs, designed to handle computationally intensive tasks. Whether you're training deep learning models, analyzing large datasets, processing images and videos, or running complex simulations, AI-LAB provides the necessary power and flexibility. 
    
    The platform integrates user-friendly software, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MATLAB, and utilizes tools like Slurm for job scheduling and Singularity for containerization, making it accessible even to those with limited technical expertise.

## Important Information

!!! info "Not for confidential or sensitive data"
    With AI-LAB you are only allowed to work with public or internal information according to [AAU’s data classification model](https://www.security.aau.dk/data-classification){target="_blank} (classified as levels 0 and 1, respectively).

    If you would like to work with confidential or sensitive data (classified as levels 2 and 3), then we support another HPC platform called [UCloud](/ucloud/).

!!! info "Not suitable for CPU-only computational tasks"
    The powerful GPU processors allow users to process large datasets much more efficiently than would be the case with pure CPU processing - given that your application can be parallelised in a GPU compatible manner. At the same time, the AI-LAB platform is not designed for CPU-only computational tasks, and we have alternative recommended platforms, such as [UCloud](/ucloud/) for those needs.

!!! info "Review the terms and conditions"
    Before getting started, take a few moments to review the [terms and conditions](/assets/terms-and-conditions-ai-lab.pdf) of using AI-LAB, and don't hesitate to [reach out](https://serviceportal.aau.dk/serviceportal?id=emp_taxonomy_topic&topic_id=82a253e8838fc21053711d447daad328){target="_blank} to our support team if you have any questions or concerns.
