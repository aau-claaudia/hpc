# Logging into AI-LAB

You connect to AI-LAB using **SSH (Secure Shell)**.

---

## 💻 Login Nodes

There are two frontend nodes:

* `ailab-fe01.srv.aau.dk`
* `ailab-fe02.srv.aau.dk`

Use either when logging in.

---

## 🔐 Logging In

Open your terminal (Windows users should use **PowerShell**) and run:

```bash
ssh user@student.aau.dk@ailab-fe01.srv.aau.dk
```

Replace `user@student.aau.dk` with your actual AAU email address.

The first time you connect, type `yes` to trust the server fingerprint.
Then enter your **AAU password** (no stars are shown while typing).
